            Well, my name is Wren, and I made this website. Yep. Everything I have
            entered into this site was input by yours truly. <br> I get asked a bunch
            of questions all the time; so as a lazy way of getting around that awkward conversation
            of getting to know someone, I have created a FAQs section, for all your curiosities.
        </p>
        <h2 class="header">FAQs</h2>
        <p class="questions">What are your hobbies?</p>
        <p class="answers">W: I like to draw, read, write and craft, but most of all, be a mother.<br></p>
        <p class="questions">Why miniatures?</p>
        <p class="answers">W: Who doesn't love tiny, cute, adorable, little versions of
            life-size furniture and food? I first started getting into miniatures when I got 
            my first 'polly pocket'. She was so small and tiny, I couldn't believe that I had 
            something so detailed, yet so small. From that moment, I knew I'd become obsessed.
            And that was 19 years ago.<br></p>
        <p class="questions">How difficult is it to create these miniatures?</p>
        <p class="answers">W: I think it depends on what you aim to make and what size you're trying to achive.
            For me, I love the scale size 1:16; this means that whatever item you aim to make is 1/16th of it's
            original scale. So an example would be, a washing machine; it's original scale is Height: 85cm and
            Width: 60cm. In 16th scale, that would shrink down to around Height: 5.3cm and Width: 3.7cm.<br>
            Tiny, right?! How on earth would someone be able to detail such a complex model on such a small item?
            Patience and detemination...(and maybe a few blood, sweat, and teary moments).
